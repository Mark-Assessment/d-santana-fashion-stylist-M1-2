## Issues found during site development

* #### Navbar links  displaying on the wrong side of the screen in desktops devices. 

When displaying the website on desktops devices , my navbar bar elements displayed on the left side of the screen right next to the logo and it making it look too crowded ruining the users experience.

> I fixed it by changing the bootstrap class name to ms-auto .


* #### The call to action botton was not centered in tablets , mobiles devices


When displayed on tablets and mobile devices the botton on the home page was looking out of placed , it was displayed on the left side. 

> I fixed this by taking it out of the buttob out of the previous div and giving it a new div with the bootstrap classes col and text-center. 


## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=es) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do several changes to improve performance, specially replacing images for lighter formats such as .webp which improved the performance significantly. Screenshots are presented below:

Before:

![performance before](docimages/lighthouse-before.png)



Final results:
![performance_final](docimages/lighthouse-results.png)

I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate my code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS


 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
